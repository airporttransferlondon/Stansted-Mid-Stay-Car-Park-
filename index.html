      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">What Is Stansted Airport Mid Stay Parking?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.minicabs.co.uk/blog/stansted-mid-stay-car-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">stansted mid stay car park</a>
 is a secure, budget-friendly parking option located just a short distance from the terminal. Ideal for travelers seeking a balance between affordability and convenience, this car park is operated by Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and offers frequent shuttle transfers directly to the terminal.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Unlike the Short Stay car park (which is steps from check-in but pricier), Mid Stay is slightly farther but offers considerable savings—especially for longer trips. It’s perfect for families, solo travelers, or business passengers looking to cut travel costs without compromising on reliability.

    <!-- Shuttle Info -->
    <section id="shuttle" class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Shuttle Bus Service Details</h2>
      <p>
        A free, 24/7 shuttle bus connects Mid Stay to the terminal every 10–15 minutes. The journey takes approximately 8–10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">Smart Alternatives: Book a Taxi Instead</h2>
      <p>
        While parking is convenient, consider the hidden costs: shuttle wait times, walking with luggage, and the stress of driving to the airport. For many Londoners, especially those in zones like Bushey, Hendon, or Kingsbury, a fixed-fare airport taxi can be a smarter, more relaxed option.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        <strong>Taxi Bushey</strong> offers reliable, fixed-price transfers to Stansted Airport with free meet-and-greet, flight tracking, and DBS-cleared drivers. With fares often **40% cheaper** than traditional London minicabs and no hidden surcharges—even during traffic—you travel with peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        First-time users get a <strong>10% discount</strong>, and you can even use promo code <code>LP5</code> for an extra 5% off. Book via app, web, or phone—your driver arrives in under 30 seconds.
